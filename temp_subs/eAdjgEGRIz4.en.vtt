00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.160
Americans have long been the biggest consumers on&nbsp;
the planet – and American consumption has grown&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:13.360
and grown over time. Americans bought sixty-eight&nbsp;
new items of clothing last year – a huge increase&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:19.120
from the twelve items a year that they used&nbsp;
to buy in the 1980’s. Their spending on that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:26.560
clothing however, has fallen. In the 1980’s the&nbsp;
average American spent 7% of their annual income&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:34.000
on clothing - while today they just spend just 3%.&nbsp;
So, for less than half the spending shoppers today&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.160
are getting almost six times as many items.
According to JP Morgan - since the turn of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:46.720
century, real personal consumption growth in&nbsp;
the United States (meaning inflation adjusted&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:52.880
consumption growth) averaged two and a half&nbsp;
percent - but in the second half of 2023,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.880 --> 00:01:00.400
that rose above 3% even with the higher interest&nbsp;
rates and elevated, but declining, inflation.
&nbsp;

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:07.440
Consumer spending accounts for almost 70% of US&nbsp;
GDP and while consumption in Europe has grown&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:13.920
over time too, Europeans tend to spend less&nbsp;
time at work than Americans, do more work at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:21.200
home and they have lower overall consumption.
For decades, the American consumer has powered&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:27.240
not just the world's biggest economy but the&nbsp;
entire global economy. According to the World Bank&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:35.120
– Americans make up around one third of global&nbsp;
consumer spending but are only 4% of the global&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:42.080
population. We should only be so surprised by&nbsp;
this – Americans are amongst the most productive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:48.400
workers in the world and thus are amongst the&nbsp;
best paid – the fact that they are both busy and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:55.920
highly paid makes them naturally big consumers.
Over the last fifty years, the United States has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.360
had just four significant dips in consumer&nbsp;
spending – the biggest having occurred in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:07.840
2020 when the global pandemic struck. At the&nbsp;
start of the pandemic Americans slashed all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:14.000
spending and we saw a massive boost in personal&nbsp;
savings as the government pumped a load of money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.480
into the economy. Nobody was traveling. People&nbsp;
couldn’t eat out. They didn’t lose their jobs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:26.800
and could suddenly work from home. Most Americans&nbsp;
continued to earn money and were simply spending&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:32.800
less. Poorer Americans who lived paycheck&nbsp;
to paycheck suddenly had free time for the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:38.400
first time in their working lives – and due&nbsp;
to stimulus checks also had savings – which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:45.040
many had never really had before. People's bank&nbsp;
accounts grew. And once the covid restrictions&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:51.760
started to ease, they went on a spending spree. 
While Americans stopped spending on restaurants,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:57.440
vacations and their daily commutes during the&nbsp;
pandemic, they spent much more on physical&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:03.520
goods – they cancelled gym memberships and bought&nbsp;
things like treadmills. During that period – the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:11.520
world spent 5% more on physical goods but the&nbsp;
undefeated American consumer spent 10% more.
&nbsp;

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:17.600
I asked my viewers in a community post - what&nbsp;
goods Americans buy that the rest of the world&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:23.440
doesn’t – the most popular answer was guns&nbsp;
and ammo – there were also huge trucks – and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:29.280
of course truck nuts. Whenever I see things&nbsp;
like that, I always imagine how confused the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.720
Chinese factory workers who make them must be.&nbsp;
I imagine they have long conversations in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.280
evening with their friends and families&nbsp;
about who buys these things and why.
&nbsp;

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:46.960
There is no way around it though, Americans do&nbsp;
love spending and not just on necessities like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:53.280
tattoos, baseball caps, massive water bottles&nbsp;
and aerosol cheese. I spoke to a friend a few&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:59.760
years ago who told me that she rents a storage&nbsp;
space to keep her seasonal decorations. I made&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:05.040
the mistake of assuming she meant Christmas&nbsp;
decorations, only to learn that there are many&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:11.040
more holidays that require inflatable decorations,&nbsp;
and that the Christmas decorations really only&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:18.480
took up about ten percent of her storage locker.
American shoppers love convenience too – not only&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:23.520
are there drive through liquor stores in the&nbsp;
United States – there are drive through bars&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:30.720
too. Some even seem to offer a Sunday morning&nbsp;
discount… In Louisiana – the Strawberry Daquiri&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:35.520
is the breakfast of champions.
According to the Bureau of Labor&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:42.480
Statistics – Americans spend twice as much&nbsp;
on jewelry, watches, books and phones today&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:49.200
as they did twenty-five years ago, new American&nbsp;
homes are almost 25% bigger today than they were&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:57.760
25 years ago, and Americans throw away five times&nbsp;
more consumer waste today than they did in 1980.
&nbsp;

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:03.840
A lot of this is driven by goods deflation where&nbsp;
things like clothing furniture and electronics&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:09.120
are cheaper than they have ever been before&nbsp;
– but the goods have often fallen in price&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:14.080
because they have declined in quality too.  
Before we dig into that let me tell you about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:19.840
this week's video sponsor DeleteMe. DeleteMe is&nbsp;
a subscription service that finds and removes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:25.680
your personal data that's being collected by&nbsp;
data brokers and sold online. Data brokers are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:31.600
businesses that collect huge amounts of personally&nbsp;
identifiable information on individuals and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:38.320
package it up to create profiles which can include&nbsp;
things like social security numbers birthdays past&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:45.040
and recent addresses information about your family&nbsp;
and much more this data can be used by identity&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:51.200
thieves or online stalkers who want to harass or&nbsp;
dox you you're legally entitled to protect your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:56.880
privacy by requesting that data brokers delete&nbsp;
the information that they store on you but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:02.640
unfortunately there are hundreds of data brokers&nbsp;
and they don't make it easy to get off their lists&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:08.880
it could take forever to do this on your own i&nbsp;
use Delete Me to reach out to the hundreds of data&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:15.920
brokers on my behalf to request the deletion of&nbsp;
my personal data and to deal with any objections&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:22.400
i got a full report back showing where my data was&nbsp;
removed from with a yearly subscription Delete Me&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:28.240
tracks them and make sure that they don't re-add&nbsp;
your data to their lists remove your personal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:34.960
information from the web using the link in the&nbsp;
description and use code BOYLE for 20% off.
&nbsp;

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:40.000
I started out with the statistic that Americans&nbsp;
are spending a much lower percentage of their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:46.880
income on clothing today than they did in the&nbsp;
1980’s but getting almost six times as many items.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:52.640
A big difference – as many people my age will know&nbsp;
is that the quality of those items has declined&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:59.120
significantly over time too. I really noticed this&nbsp;
a few years ago when one of my favorite shirts was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:05.040
getting a bit old – and I went online to see if&nbsp;
I could find the exact same one to buy. Not was I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:11.200
able to find it, but the price was cheaper than I&nbsp;
remembered. When it arrived in the post though and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:17.280
I held it up next to the old one – it was made of&nbsp;
a thinner cheaper fabric, the stitching was worse,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:23.360
and it just didn’t fit the way the old one had. I&nbsp;
went online to return it – and instead of sending&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:29.360
me a shipping label – the seller just gave me&nbsp;
a full refund and told me to throw it out.
&nbsp;

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:35.520
I looked online to find old clothing adverts&nbsp;
from the 1980’s so that I could compare the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:43.280
prices to similar items you can buy today. This&nbsp;
Sears catalogue from 1980 shows a sport coat for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:49.440
$90 dollars and a topcoat for $130 dollars&nbsp;
– both of these items were on sale at the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:55.840
time. If we adjust for inflation – the&nbsp;
sport coat costs $350 dollars and the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:55.840 --> 00:08:03.520
topcoat over 500 dollars in 2025 dollars.
Going to the Sears website today they have a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:11.280
$50 dollar blazer and a $140 dollar topcoat – so&nbsp;
quite a bit cheaper than in the past. The 1980&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:17.440
advert – you’ll notice - focused on the quality&nbsp;
of the materials – The wool is handwoven Harris&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:23.840
tweed from Scotland – the advert tells us about&nbsp;
the lining and the leather wrapped buttons too.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:29.840
You’ll notice that both items come in a number&nbsp;
of different sizes too. The modern item – which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:35.680
is celebrity endorsed - gives us none of that&nbsp;
information – other than that it can cause cancer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:42.000
and reproductive harm to California residents&nbsp;
(which is really why I’d never live there) and the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:48.720
topcoat is one size fits all – which I guess makes&nbsp;
sense – as we are all the same size nowadays…
&nbsp;

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:54.560
If your dad bought that tweed blazer 45&nbsp;
years ago – he likely still has it in his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:59.360
closet today – while if you are planning&nbsp;
on buying either of the new items – I’d&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:04.320
recommend having them shipped straight to&nbsp;
the landfill to cut out the middleman.
&nbsp;

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:09.440
Shall we look again at the quality of the&nbsp;
photo they are using to advertise that topcoat?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:14.640
They clearly spared no cost in putting that&nbsp;
advert together. It’s aimed squarely at the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:22.080
man who uses Siri or Alexa to buy his clothes.
Alexa – buy me a coat --- no – I don’t live in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:25.040
California – that shouldn’t&nbsp;
affect me… It’ll be fine…
&nbsp;

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:31.840
The way the clothing industry works has changed a&nbsp;
lot over the years. In the 1980’s it used to take&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:37.920
around nine months for an item of clothing to be&nbsp;
designed – a big store like Sears would then order&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:44.240
each item in bulk in a variety of different sizes&nbsp;
– and these items would be available in the store&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:50.960
for maybe six months. If they didn’t sell this was&nbsp;
a problem – and for this reason a lot of thought,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:56.400
went into finding the right items and&nbsp;
providing quality at every price point.
&nbsp;

00:09:56.400 --> 00:10:03.680
The term fast fashion first appeared in 1989 in&nbsp;
a New York Times article about a new retailer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:11.040
at the time called Zara. Zara they explained was&nbsp;
able to go from idea – to having an item in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:18.160
store in 15 days because they had built a network&nbsp;
of factories around their headquarters in Spain.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:24.000
They would manufacture small test batches of&nbsp;
clothes - ship them to the stores – discontinue&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:30.320
the ones that didn’t sell and ramp production in&nbsp;
the items that customers bought. Their approach&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:36.320
didn’t require them to predict trends – they&nbsp;
just had to respond quickly to demand. They&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:41.680
were able to make copies of high-end designer&nbsp;
clothes within weeks – and make them available&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:49.280
cheaply by using low quality fabrics and zips.
Fast fashion brands over time started putting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:54.240
spandex in everything – as the more the&nbsp;
fabric stretches – the fewer sizes you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:59.760
have to make – this reduces manufacturing&nbsp;
costs even further – but it also means that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:05.920
clothes never fit all that well to begin&nbsp;
with and they wear out very quickly.
&nbsp;

00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:11.040
The same sort of thing that happened with&nbsp;
clothing happened with furniture too. People&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:17.360
were happy to buy disposable furniture as long&nbsp;
as it was cheap and on trend. We started to see&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:23.200
manufactured goods where plastic was used where&nbsp;
metal used to go and glue was used instead of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:30.400
fasteners. These new products were cheap – which&nbsp;
people like – but they didn’t really last.
&nbsp;

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:38.000
Chinese brands like Shein and Temu managed to&nbsp;
undercut Zara – by moving even faster - having&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:43.680
no physical stores – not owning the factories&nbsp;
(instead treating them like uber drivers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:50.480
hooked up to an app) and exploiting a tax&nbsp;
loophole known as the de minimis exemption.
&nbsp;

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:58.000
The de minimis exemption became law in the United&nbsp;
States in 1930, to allow Americans to skip import&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:03.600
duties for small-value shipments. It was put&nbsp;
in place so that people could bring souvenirs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:09.760
home from their holidays without being taxed. Most&nbsp;
countries around the world have a version of this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:15.920
rule – but the United States had the highest&nbsp;
exemption rate of $800 dollars per item. 
&nbsp;

00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:21.120
Americans who have ordered goods from&nbsp;
another country online that cost less than&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:26.720
$800 dollars over the last ten years have&nbsp;
benefited from the de minimis exemption.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:33.040
If they had bought the same item from a local&nbsp;
store, the price would have been a lot higher&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:38.160
as it would have had to include the cost&nbsp;
of manufacturing, shipping, warehousing,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:43.600
along with the store’s rent, and the wages&nbsp;
of the U.S. employee who works there. 
&nbsp;

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:50.160
Both Republicans and Democrats have talked about&nbsp;
ending this exemption for quite some time – as it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:55.520
made it impossible for stores to compete with&nbsp;
brands like Temu and Shein – who could avoid&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:55.520 --> 00:13:02.800
most of those costs and pay none of the taxes or&nbsp;
fees a larger-volume importer would have to pay.
&nbsp;

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:09.360
The de minimis loophole hasn’t yet closed — but&nbsp;
it’s about to. Starting on May 2nd, packages&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:17.600
from China will be hit with a 120 percent tax on&nbsp;
the value of the goods or a $100 flat fee, which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:24.160
will increase to $200 per package this June.
With the dollar almost ten percent off its&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:30.640
January highs, massive tariffs on imported goods&nbsp;
in place and big American businesses announcing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:36.480
layoffs – the all-conquering American&nbsp;
consumer might finally slow down.
&nbsp;

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:41.120
One of the oldest sayings on Wall Street&nbsp;
is that you should never bet against the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:47.680
American Consumer – the people who buy Truck Nuts&nbsp;
don’t put their credit cards down that easily.
&nbsp;

00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:53.840
According to Juliet Schor, a sociologist at&nbsp;
Boston College, the key driver of consumer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:53.840 --> 00:14:00.000
spending in America is the role that consumption&nbsp;
plays in establishing an individual’s position&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:07.200
in an unequal society. She says that Americans&nbsp;
consume to keep up with their social group.
&nbsp;

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:12.160
According to her research, people who have&nbsp;
reference groups that are wealthier than they are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:18.320
- tend to spend more to keep up, and people who&nbsp;
have more modest reference groups, even as they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:24.960
gain in income and wealth, tend to save more.
According to Scientific American 6 to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:30.480
7 per cent of Americans say they have a&nbsp;
shopping addiction – and research shows&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:36.560
that online shopping is more addictive than in&nbsp;
store shopping as buyers get both the thrill of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:43.760
buying – and then the excitement of delivery&nbsp;
a few days later. Shopping apps like Temu use&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:50.960
gamification to draw in customers – where shoppers&nbsp;
describe it as feeling like an online casino.
&nbsp;

00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:57.360
A Penn State paper analyzing shopping behavior&nbsp;
found that compulsive shoppers tend to search&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:57.360 --> 00:15:03.440
for relatively cheap items when shopping (but&nbsp;
then buy lots of them). Apparently, shoes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:09.520
jewelry, and cosmetics rank among the top five&nbsp;
categories of compulsive shoppers’ purchases.
&nbsp;

00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:14.480
With high import tariffs kicking in and&nbsp;
the end of the de minimis exemption on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:20.960
horizon – Americans can expect to see significant&nbsp;
price inflation in the near future – unless all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:27.360
of these new rules are rolled back – as well may&nbsp;
happen. The press is reporting that many Americans&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:33.520
have already rushed out to stock up on goods&nbsp;
before the prices rise. There was a big spike in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:39.760
new car purchases last month – as buyers who may&nbsp;
have been holding off on buying a new car – rushed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:45.200
out to get one for fear that the prices would&nbsp;
be much higher if they waited any longer.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:52.800
Bloomberg reports that Americans rushed out to&nbsp;
replace their iphones too before prices go up.
&nbsp;

00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:59.120
Many Americans are reported to be cutting back on&nbsp;
spending on services – like restaurants, hotels&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:05.920
and haircuts as they prepare for an economic&nbsp;
slowdown. New York magazine reports that Chinese&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:12.720
websites like Shein and Temu are raising prices&nbsp;
starting on April 25th and shipping companies&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:20.640
like FedEx and UPS have already added a “surge&nbsp;
fee” for goods entering the U.S. from China.
&nbsp;

00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:26.160
Some people have argued that if prices go up&nbsp;
due to tariffs that Americans will just start&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:32.800
buying smaller quantities of higher quality goods.&nbsp;
There is no real reason to believe that however.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:39.520
Typically tariffs drive up the price of imported&nbsp;
goods – but they also allow domestic producers to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:46.400
increase their prices – which they typically do.
Ramon Van Meer – who runs a business selling&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:53.360
shower heads ran an experiment on his website&nbsp;
to see how many buyers would pay more for an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:53.360 --> 00:17:00.080
American manufactured shower head. He gave&nbsp;
shoppers the option to buy a $129 dollar made&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:07.680
in Asia showerhead or the same product – but&nbsp;
made in America for $239 dollars – the price&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:16.560
it would cost. He sold 584 of the made in Asia&nbsp;
showerheads and no Made in America showerheads. 
&nbsp;

00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:23.120
Apparently American Apparel ran a similar&nbsp;
experiment in 2017 with a much more modest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:30.080
price difference and the majority of customers&nbsp;
still chose the cheaper – imported version.
&nbsp;

00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:37.040
The Atlantic reports that trends like zero waste&nbsp;
households, capsule wardrobes and minimalism are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:42.160
generating more and more interest amongst&nbsp;
Americans who are concerned about the waste&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:48.080
they create. Farah Khalique reports that&nbsp;
stores selling secondhand goods are poised&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:54.080
to benefit from the new tariffs as consumers&nbsp;
look to avoid higher prices by searching for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:54.080 --> 00:18:01.680
higher quality goods at lower prices.
The moral critique of consumerism is that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:07.760
buying goods can displace more worthwhile&nbsp;
activities or more important priorities,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:13.680
but consumption does also create jobs,&nbsp;
stimulate economic growth and can increase&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:19.200
our quality of life and standard of living.
