00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:05.920
Two days after its release, last week’s video on&nbsp;
the Epstein files was on track to become the most&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:11.600
successful upload in my channel’s history.&nbsp;
It had gained a million views in 24 hours,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:17.200
outpacing my previous record holder&nbsp;
by nearly 40 percent. The trajectory&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:22.640
suggested that I had a big hit on my hands.
Then, a yellow dollar sign appeared on my&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.440
YouTube dashboard, signaling that the&nbsp;
video had been "demonetized." You would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:32.400
expect that to mean that I just stop earning&nbsp;
ad revenue from the video - but in practice,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:38.880
the consequences are a bit more severe. When a&nbsp;
video is deemed inappropriate to run ads on - the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:45.040
platform’s incentive to distribute that video&nbsp;
evaporates. The recommendation engine – which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:51.200
is designed to maximize revenue for YouTube,&nbsp;
quietly shelves the content – viewers can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:57.440
still find it if they look for it - but for my&nbsp;
video - the view count flatlined immediately.
&nbsp;

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:03.600
The platform provided no specific reason for the&nbsp;
decision, just the statement that the video was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:09.200
not advertiser friendly. Sometimes I’m told –&nbsp;
they’ll tell you which precise moment in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:15.360
video was deemed offensive – and you can then&nbsp;
clip that section out. In this case – it says&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:21.360
that after a human review (which I requested)&nbsp;
that there are controversial issues throughout&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:27.120
the video – meaning that there is nothing that I&nbsp;
can do to make it acceptable. When I go through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:32.880
the video and look at YouTubes policies -&nbsp;
their decision is difficult to understand.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:39.200
The content was a thirty-seven-minute analysis&nbsp;
of the inconsistencies in the Epstein files,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:45.120
specifically with regard to FBI redactions that&nbsp;
appeared to violate the Transparency Law passed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:52.880
by Congress. The video contained no profanity, no&nbsp;
violence, no descriptions of Epstein’s activities&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:59.600
and no inappropriate imagery was shown on screen.
The audience metrics confirm that the content&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:06.240
was not offensive to viewers. At the time of&nbsp;
demonetization, the video had accrued 90,000&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:13.920
likes and maintained a like-to-dislike ratio&nbsp;
of 98.9 percent - which is an unusually high&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:20.960
approval rating for a video – higher than on most&nbsp;
of my videos, implying that the viewers—the very&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:28.320
people advertisers supposedly need protection&nbsp;
from - found the content acceptable and valuable.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:35.360
The title, "The Epstein Files are Worse Than You&nbsp;
Think!", was unambiguous too. No viewer clicked&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:41.520
on it expecting a cooking tutorial only to be&nbsp;
ambushed by a critique of the justice system.
&nbsp;

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:54.960
To understand why this happens on YouTube, we&nbsp;
need to look back to the 'YouTube Adpocalypse.'&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:54.960 --> 00:03:00.800
Years ago, after Logan Paul’s infamous vlog&nbsp;
from a Japanese forest triggered a massive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:08.160
advertiser exodus, big brands paused their YouTube&nbsp;
advertising campaigns. It was a simple commercial&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:14.400
calculation: they worried that appearing next&nbsp;
to offensive content (like a Logan Paul video)&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:20.080
might be misconstrued as an endorsement&nbsp;
or simply link their brand to something&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:27.040
awful in the viewer's mind. YouTube responded by&nbsp;
drastically tightening its creator guidelines.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:33.600
If you wanted to earn advertising money on the&nbsp;
platform – you couldn’t behave like Logan Paul…
&nbsp;

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:39.840
Now, I recognize that YouTube is a for-profit&nbsp;
business. As a creator whose videos are often&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:46.240
sponsored, I am also accustomed to dealing with&nbsp;
advertisers and fully appreciate their concerns.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:51.440
Businesses have a clear duty to protect&nbsp;
their brands, and YouTube needs to organize&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:56.640
the platform to secure that revenue.&nbsp;
This arrangement benefits everyone:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:03.680
advertiser spending funds the whole ecosystem.&nbsp;
If a video is genuinely hateful or dangerous,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:10.000
demonetization is a logical business decision&nbsp;
for YouTube as it preserves free speech while&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:16.800
insulating advertisers from toxic content. The&nbsp;
problem is that this mechanism has evolved into a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:23.840
blunt instrument that penalizes serious journalism&nbsp;
under the guise of brand safety. Advertisers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:29.920
routinely buy slots on mainstream cable news&nbsp;
programs that discuss war, crime, and political&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:37.280
corruption. Yet when an independent creator&nbsp;
examines these same topics with equal rigor,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:43.280
the algorithm flags it as being inappropriate.
The evidence suggests that we are not dealing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:50.480
with a calculated conspiracy to silence a specific&nbsp;
controversial story, but instead a broken system&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:56.240
at YouTube. I spoke with a friend who runs a&nbsp;
much larger channel than mine who has produced&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:02.480
multiple videos on the same topic – and asked&nbsp;
whether his Epstein videos had been demonetized,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:09.200
given that two of my three uploads on the subject&nbsp;
have now been penalized. He reported no issues,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:15.360
noting only that he is careful to avoid profanity&nbsp;
and that he bleeps out any sensitive terms.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:20.640
This is reassuring, as it implies there&nbsp;
is nothing sinister at play. However,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:27.360
it reveals that YouTube has an arbitrary system&nbsp;
where demonetization depends less on the subject&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:32.960
matter and possibly more on the algorithmic&nbsp;
status of the uploader. Of course, given the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:39.760
platform's opacity, we can’t know this for sure.
There has been some research on how Demonetization&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:46.480
works on YouTube – but before I go through that –&nbsp;
let me tell you about our video sponsor Saily - an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:52.080
e sim provider who makes it incredibly easy&nbsp;
to travel and stay connected without having&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:58.000
to pay ridiculous foreign roaming charges, find&nbsp;
a local SIM card or waste your time constantly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.840
trying to find public Wi-Fi. I hadn't heard of&nbsp;
this technology before trying out Saily this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:08.240
summer - but it's an app that you install&nbsp;
on your phone which allows you to stay&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:14.720
connected in over 200 places around the world.
There is no need to buy and swap physical SIM&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:20.160
cards when you travel.You just download the&nbsp;
app once and use it whenever you are abroad.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:25.920
You choose how much data you want and for how&nbsp;
long. It's way cheaper than roaming and takes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:31.520
seconds to set up. You just select the country you&nbsp;
are travelling to and plan and activate an e-SIM&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:37.360
before you leave home - when you land, your phone&nbsp;
automatically connects to a local network with no&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:43.600
hidden charges. There is no fussing around at&nbsp;
the airport, you can book an uber, access GPS&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:49.520
or make a call. So if you've got travel plans,&nbsp;
click the link in the description or scan this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:56.480
QR code to download the app. Then choose a plan in&nbsp;
the country you're going to and use my code BOYLE,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:04.320
at checkout to get an exclusive 15% discount.
Researchers have termed this problem "censorship&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:09.680
by proxy." A 2022 study found&nbsp;
that demonetization effectively&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:16.960
acts as a censor because it creates a financial&nbsp;
disincentive for creators to cover "risky" topics.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:22.000
The study’s machine learning models show that the&nbsp;
algorithm favors "safe" metrics like channel size&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:29.120
and video duration over the specific details of&nbsp;
the content. Creators essentially build up trust&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:35.760
with the algorithm - and once trusted, are less&nbsp;
likely to be demonetized. This possibly explains&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:41.840
why my second Epstein video was demonetized&nbsp;
so quickly. The study also shows that when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:48.000
the algorithm decides a topic is "unsafe,"&nbsp;
it restricts distribution, making the content&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:54.480
almost invisible to all but the most dedicated&nbsp;
subscribers who will seek every new video out.
&nbsp;

00:07:54.480 --> 00:08:01.040
This "safety" filter—as the authors&nbsp;
note—notoriously fails to grasp context.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:07.360
The channel Vlogging Through History documented&nbsp;
this issue, reporting that his educational videos&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:13.760
on World War Two were demonetized simply for&nbsp;
displaying a two-second clip of a flag from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:19.440
that period - or for discussing the bad thing&nbsp;
that happened in 2001. The algorithm groups&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:24.960
Nick [CENSOR] and a historian explaining&nbsp;
an important World War two battle into the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:30.480
same category – and then - both face&nbsp;
the same penalty: the revenue cliff.
&nbsp;

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:36.960
For this reason, creators sometimes feel forced to&nbsp;
modify their language to survive. This has given&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:43.600
rise to what is known as 'algospeak,' a surreal&nbsp;
new online dialect where creators replace clinical&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:50.080
terms with nonsense words—saying 'something'&nbsp;
instead of 'something else' or 'PF file' instead&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:57.280
of 'bleep'—hoping to slip past the automated&nbsp;
filters. Serious discourse then becomes a childish&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:04.000
code, degrading the quality of information in&nbsp;
exchange for algorithmic safety. In my video,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:09.120
I used the correct terms because it seems&nbsp;
ridiculous to me to speak in a code that my&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:18.560
audience might not understand—and because we&nbsp;
are discussing a serious topic. The algorithm&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:26.400
responded by demonetizing the video.
This type of suppression matters because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:33.520
the format of online video offers something&nbsp;
traditional media often can’t: depth. A cable news&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:41.440
segment typically lasts four minutes; a newspaper&nbsp;
article runs for around 700 words. My video was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:46.240
thirty-seven minutes long – and attempted to&nbsp;
give a balanced view of what had been revealed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:52.880
by the government and why it matters. This long&nbsp;
form format allows for a detailed examination&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:52.880 --> 00:10:00.000
of complex timelines—such as the fact that Epstein&nbsp;
was first reported to the FBI in 1996, or that his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:07.440
financial crimes date back to the 1970s. It allows&nbsp;
us to explore the systemic failures of the FBI and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:15.040
the DOJ that span multiple administrations, rather&nbsp;
than reducing the story to a partisan soundbite.
&nbsp;

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:20.880
When algorithms penalize this type of depth&nbsp;
and discussion, they don't just hurt creators;&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:27.840
they harm public understanding of complex topics.&nbsp;
The released Epstein files are heavily redacted,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:33.680
often in ways that don’t appear to comply with&nbsp;
the Transparency Law. These redactions obscure&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:40.480
the names of potential co-conspirators while&nbsp;
leaving victims exposed. Covering these dry,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:46.720
procedural details is essential for holding&nbsp;
power to account, yet it is exactly this type&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:52.880
of content that can be judged "non-advertiser&nbsp;
friendly” – by the algorithm – even if not by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:52.880 --> 00:11:00.800
advertisers – like my video sponsors or viewers. 
This creates a bizarre paradox. Mainstream news&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:05.360
outlets in many parts of the world are&nbsp;
increasingly buckling under financial&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:11.920
and regulatory pressure. It is not just about&nbsp;
threats from the FCC to strip broadcast licenses;&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:16.720
it is about the bottom line. We have seen&nbsp;
networks pay millions in settlements to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:23.440
politicians to resolve legal disputes, effectively&nbsp;
paying for their right to operate. We saw this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:29.600
quite clearly when Bari Weiss recently shelved&nbsp;
a fully vetted 60 Minutes investigation into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:36.400
deportations because she said the White House&nbsp;
had refused to comment. As the correspondent&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:42.720
noted - if the government’s refusal to participate&nbsp;
becomes a valid reason to spike a story, we have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:49.840
effectively handed them a "kill switch" for any&nbsp;
reporting they find inconvenient. Simultaneously,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:55.600
corporate consolidation has become a point of&nbsp;
political leverage. The Warner Bros. Discovery&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:55.600 --> 00:12:02.640
merger remains stalled in regulatory limbo, with&nbsp;
the administration signaling that approval hinges&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:09.200
on 'correcting' the editorial stance of its&nbsp;
news division, CNN. For media conglomerates&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:15.200
burdened by massive debt, this creates an&nbsp;
existential dilemma: they can maintain their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:21.360
journalistic independence, or they can secure&nbsp;
the regulatory approval they need to survive.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:28.000
Increasing numbers are choosing survival.
The independent creators who fill the gap&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:35.120
fare no better. The United States has recently&nbsp;
fallen to 57th out of 180 countries when ranked&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:40.960
for press freedom. It is seemingly easier&nbsp;
for politicians to coerce the few remaining&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:47.520
broadcast giants than to go after millions of&nbsp;
independent bloggers, podcasters, and YouTubers.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:53.920
Yet, if the primary platform for independent&nbsp;
video journalism effectively taxes serious&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:53.920 --> 00:13:00.160
reporting by removing its revenue and its reach,&nbsp;
that ranking will likely slide even lower."
&nbsp;

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:06.720
YouTube is not merely an American platform;&nbsp;
it has global reach. In countries with strict&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:12.560
state censorship, citizens often rely on&nbsp;
VPNs to access YouTube as one of their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:18.720
few windows into the unfiltered world. If the&nbsp;
platform itself begins to sanitize content to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:25.440
appease Western politicians or advertisers, it&nbsp;
inadvertently aligns itself with the goals of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:32.640
those restrictive regimes. By disincentivizing the&nbsp;
coverage of serious topics, YouTube shuts off the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:38.400
'escape valve' for global information,&nbsp;
homogenizing the internet into a safe,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:45.520
corporate-friendly feed that challenges no one.
There is a distinct irony to digital censorship:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:50.160
the Streisand Effect. Attempts to&nbsp;
suppress information often make it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:56.720
more popular. After I posted a community update&nbsp;
explaining that my video had been demonetized,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:56.720 --> 00:14:01.440
thousands of viewers watched the video&nbsp;
specifically because it had been flagged.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:07.440
The like to dislike ratio went even higher and&nbsp;
many new viewers subscribed to the channel.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:14.800
Viewers understand that in an era of algorithmic&nbsp;
curation, the "unsafe" label is sometimes a proxy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:21.280
for "important." Similarly the 60 minutes episode&nbsp;
that had been shelved by Bari Weiss – had already&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:26.640
been broadcast in Canada – Canadian viewers&nbsp;
uploaded it to the internet and it quickly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:32.800
went viral online as viewers rushed to see the&nbsp;
episode that they had not been allowed to see.
&nbsp;

00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:37.520
It is crucial to distinguish between the&nbsp;
"politics" of this case and the "morality"&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:42.640
of it. My critique of the decline in press&nbsp;
freedom under the current administration&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:48.720
should not be misconstrued as a partisan attack.&nbsp;
The failure to prosecute Jeffrey Epstein and his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:54.720
co-conspirators is not a Republican issue or&nbsp;
a Democrat issue; it is a moral issue that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:54.720 --> 00:15:01.840
hints at the institutional rot in our justice&nbsp;
system that spans decades and administrations.
&nbsp;

00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:08.080
History shows that press freedom is vulnerable&nbsp;
under leadership of any stripe. While attacks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:13.600
on the press have risen by 25 percent this&nbsp;
year, a look at the data from the U.S. Press&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:19.600
Freedom Tracker reveals that the highest number&nbsp;
of journalists arrested or assaulted in recent&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:25.440
history actually occurred in 2020. These&nbsp;
incidents were largely linked to the civil&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:30.560
unrest surrounding the Black Lives Matter&nbsp;
protests and the enforcement of pandemic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:36.960
restrictions—these protests were concentrated&nbsp;
in cities and states governed by Democrats—and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:42.080
so it is no surprise that with a spike in&nbsp;
violence in these states there was also a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:48.080
spike in violence against journalists. This&nbsp;
shows that the urge to suppress uncomfortable&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:54.960
press coverage is not unique to one party; it&nbsp;
is a reflex of power that manifests whenever&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:54.960 --> 00:16:02.000
the streets—or the internet—become too noisy.
This is why the Epstein case is so critical:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:07.840
it unites the public against that oppressive&nbsp;
reflex. The legislative push to release&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:14.240
the Epstein files enjoyed rare bipartisan&nbsp;
support. Congress voted almost unanimously&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:19.920
to bring these documents to light; only&nbsp;
one lawmaker voted against the release. 
&nbsp;

00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:26.400
The frustration about how this case is being dealt&nbsp;
with is not limited to Washington either. At a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:32.880
recent Turning Point USA event—a gathering of the&nbsp;
MAGA faithful—Laura Ingraham asked the audience&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:44.864
to clap if they were satisfied with the results&nbsp;
of the Epstein investigation. The room didn’t&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:58.240
clap. They booed. People of all political&nbsp;
persuasions get what the algorithm seems&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:03.760
to be missing - that the Epstein story is&nbsp;
a moral scandal about a two-tier justice&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:09.680
system, not a political football.
This shared outrage makes the 'unsafe'&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:15.840
categorization by YouTube even more baffling.&nbsp;
The public is united in wanting to know why,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:22.240
for example, current FBI Director Kash Patel&nbsp;
claimed there were no perpetrators other than&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:29.040
Epstein, when the released files indicate the&nbsp;
FBI identified ten potential co-conspirators.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:34.160
They want to know why Patel claimed to have&nbsp;
seen footage proving nothing untoward happened&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:39.120
in Epstein’s cell, only to release a video&nbsp;
recorded in a different part of the cell&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:45.360
block with a critical minute of footage&nbsp;
conspicuously missing due to a 'glitch’.
&nbsp;

00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:51.680
Covering these discrepancies is not "hate speech"&nbsp;
or "harassment." It is the basic function of a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:58.160
free press. When smaller channels see my video&nbsp;
get demonetized, they are likely to take note.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:02.080
If you are running a small channel and are&nbsp;
relying on advertising checks to pay your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:09.120
rent - the signal sent by demonetization would be&nbsp;
clear: "Don’t touch this topic. Stick to gaming.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:15.280
Stick to drama. Leave the questioning of authority&nbsp;
to the professionals at news organizations who are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:21.520
currently too frightened to actually do it.”
A final, bitter irony defines this whole&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:28.000
experience. The algorithm can quickly flag&nbsp;
my video as "advertiser unfriendly" yet it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:35.200
fails to police actual fraud. In recent weeks, my&nbsp;
likeness has been used here on YouTube in deepfake&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:54.480
videos promoting scams. Despite my repeated&nbsp;
reports, YouTube has been slow to remove these&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:54.480 --> 00:19:01.440
impersonations. We are left with a system that&nbsp;
penalizes journalism for being too serious, while&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:09.360
dragging its feet on removing AI-generated fakes.
The yellow demonetization icon offers one positive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:16.880
aspect – and that is transparency. Being notified&nbsp;
of demonetization is preferable to being silently&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:22.960
throttled in the background, a practice known as&nbsp;
'shadowbanning.' At least I am told when I’ve been&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:28.960
censored, even if the reasoning remains vague.&nbsp;
In other parts of the world, censorship is a much&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:35.200
more frightening event. Here, it is not a knock&nbsp;
on the door, but a quiet algorithmic nudge. It is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:41.520
less dramatic, but in the long run, it may be just&nbsp;
as effective at narrowing the public discourse.
&nbsp;

00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:47.040
My plan is to continue covering the topics I&nbsp;
find interesting and that I think my viewers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:53.360
will find interesting too - whether the videos are&nbsp;
monetized or not. But for the broader ecosystem,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:59.760
this algorithmic censorship is worth worrying&nbsp;
about. It forces us to ask what YouTube wants&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:06.320
to be. If the platform’s incentives aggressively&nbsp;
filter out the "boring" work of holding power to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:12.800
account—the deep dives, the legal analysis,&nbsp;
the historical context—then it ceases to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:18.640
a digital public square. It risks becoming&nbsp;
a place solely for childish entertainment,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:25.696
safe for advertisers but useless for democracy.
If you want to watch my demonetized video – here&nbsp;&nbsp;
